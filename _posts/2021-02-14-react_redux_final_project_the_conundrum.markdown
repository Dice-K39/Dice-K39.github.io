Finally, the final project for the coursework. The apex of the program! Well it was not a paved road where you can easily walk to point A to point B. It was a very, very tough uphill battle. The first three modules was simple because all three modules was about Ruby. If the modules was taken into a mathematical perspective, it would be a logarithmic curve on the coordinate system.The final two modules comes by and the logarithmic curve suddenly turned into an exponential curve!

Anyway, the final project is based on the JavaScript project that I have done because of time constraints. As usual, I had a hard time selecting a project idea. On the start of project week, I decided on doing a Youtube clone. That idea burned to the ground because I had no idea where to start from. Then I found a mp3 player online that uses local mp3 files from the user's computer and plays them. That was about halfway through the first week of project week and I decided on cloning that. I had a hard time trying to create a similar player without using the code available for that mp3 player. That used up most of the second week of project week. I went to my cohort lead and talked about the conundrum that I had. We came to the conclusion that I should just do the JavaScript Project in React. I had used up too much time trying to make the mp3 player work disregarding the time it was taking me. 

One thing I learned from this is that I have a hard time trying to get things started when it is open-ended. I should have chosen something that is simple and yet shows that I have learned something from the module. Also, I would have been able to show my future employer that I am capable of learning a functionality outside of what I learned from the course work.
