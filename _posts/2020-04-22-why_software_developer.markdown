Why did I decide to learn software development? Good question but there is a better question: “Why did I not pursue software development?” What I mean by that is in the “dark ages” called college I studied programming. Before that, I was a music major and touched on computer science my last year there. It piqued my interest. Few years pass by I went to another school and got my Associates in Applied Science degree in a “computer science”-ish degree. Then I went to another school to get my bachelors degree in another “computer science”-ish degree. What is the result of all this schooling? A job at a restaurant, a moving company, whole-sale warehouse, and my current job of sales at the whole-sale warehouse. If you ask me, I think I went through the “Dark Swamp of Despair” and possibly deeper through those years (maybe I went into a sink hole at the bottom of the swamp, who knows?). Yes, it is a bit depressing but that is pretty much it.

Since starting the whole-sale warehouse job, my life has been getting better. Until a certain game releasing on my smart phone, I have not considered programming/coding at all. After I installed and loaded this game, I was amazed at how a small device can run a game that has computer graphics on par with current generation gaming consoles. That made me get back into programming and try out different game engine technologies that were free to use. I thought to myself that I had to get back to programming more often because I genuinely enjoy piecing together lines of code to make programs do something. That is why I am going to pursue to become a software developer, hopefully a game developer.
