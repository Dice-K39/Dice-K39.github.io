Like ice cream flavors, there are many different kinds of programming languages out in the world. For non-programmers, picking a language will be tough so usually they go for popular languages such as JavaScript or Python. Bootcamps, such as Flatiron (one that I am in by the way. . .) offer Ruby and JavaScript for their Software Engineering program (they should rename it to Full Stack Developer, in my opinion . . .). Larger colleges offer other programming languages such as C++ and Java. Other than some of these modern programming languages there are old languages such as COBOL, which is used for business, finance, and government systems, and FORTRAN for scientific and engineering applications.

Main thing to keep in mind is to focus on a select few languages such as what Flatiron is offering (JavaScript and Ruby) and work at becoming an expert at it. I enjoyed learning Ruby and JavaScript but I took interest in learning C# during the course of my studies at Flatiron. C# is a versatile programming language that it can be used to make software, web applications, and games. There are new concepts to learn in C# but some concepts such as OOP, classes, inheritance can be related to other programming languages that I have learned. Hopefully, I will be able to grasp most of the concepts in C# so that I will be able to get my ideal job.

So which flavor of programming language(s) are you going to choose?
