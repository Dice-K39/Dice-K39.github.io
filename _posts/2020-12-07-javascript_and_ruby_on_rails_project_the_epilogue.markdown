This project had a steep learning curve. The module was a total mess because it started talking about the DOM rather than start off from the basic principles of the language. I see the reasoning behind it: the DOM is pretty hard to manipulate so the module creator thought it was best to put it at the beginning of the module so it will eventually click into the students minds. For me it never clicked until this project. The small tidbits of labs that was assigned never really helped me grasp the concept. The project really helped me understand every little tidbits of DOM manipulation. Practice makes perfect like some say.

My project ended up with 5 AJAX calls which minimum was set at 3. AJAX is an acronym that stands for **A**synchronous **J**avaScript **A**nd **X**ML. It is a technique that results in having a really engaging page using HTML and CSS which is rendered quickly and, with JavaScript add more to the DOM.

AJAX relies on:

* Promises
* XMLHttpRequestObjects
* Serialization format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
* Asynchronocity
* Event Loop

Without practice, AJAX is a hard concept to grasp. It is done by using `fetch`. It will ask the server for data which will be eventually returned in JSON format. 

I think the project again saved me from falling face first into the ground. The module again is really in a mess and would do good if students have other sources to suppliment the module. I am glad that everything clicked before the assessment because I think everyone in my cohort is dreading it . . . except me. I am pretty crazy . . . in programming.
