My Ruby on Rails project is a simple take on project management. I know for sure that it still requires so much work to make a decent app to manage a project or many projects. From the CLI project to the Sinatra project, this was enjoyable to create and also required deep thinking of what I wanted to achieve through code. I believe I have accomplished more from this project than the CLI and/or the Sinatra project. There are still many tasks that I need to finish on this project but I am satisfied with the work I have done. I know I could of done better though.

I was watching all kinds of Youtube videos coming up with what to do for my project. My CLI and Sinatra project concentrated on nerdy things like video games and things of interest. I wanted to graduate from that and came up with the idea to do something like a bug tracker at first. I met up with my cohort lead about the idea but insisted on me doing something else because my associations were a bit off. I believe it went something like . . .

I could not make any sense of it either. I dont remember from where I learned this but I learned that if you can make a sentence that makes sense out of the models then there can be an association between them. I threw the bug tracker idea out the window and decided to do a project management app. I went by my cohort lead if this was any better than the last idea and he agreed it was better. This is my final form of the relational diagram that I came up with (literally the last update was on the final stretch to turn in the project):

A programmer has many assignments and has many projects through assignments . . . A project has many assignments and has many programmers through assignments . . . A comment belongs to a programmer and an assignment. . . Everything makes sense. I think I could of went a bit farther such as a project has many comments through assignments but I wanted to keep it simple since I needed to get the Minimal Viable Product (MVP). 

All in all, I think I did fine with only two weeks time to create a functional app in Ruby on Rails. I will work on this even after I submit this project because I want this to be a functional app that does everything that I want it to do. Plus, I added spec files from using generators so I can start learning how to code tests. Hopefully this will help me in finding a job after I graduate.
